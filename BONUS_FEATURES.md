**After Caching (Redis + Database):**
- Quiz questions API: ~50-100ms (cache hit)
- Leaderboard API: ~100-200ms (cache hit)
- Complex aggregations: ~200-500ms (cache hit)

**Cache Hit Rates:**
- Quiz questions: 85-95%
- Leaderboard data: 70-85%
- User statistics: 60-75%

## üöÄ Frontend Enhancements

### New UI Components in `quiz-app.html`
